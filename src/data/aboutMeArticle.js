    description: 'For me building things from scratch is an enjoyment and bringing ideas to life is a lifestyle. In the past I tried many other career paths - from road construction engineering, to pursuing sports career. Yet again, after the start of COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself on a new path - a path in which my passion and my enjoyment are always the leading part of the process.'
